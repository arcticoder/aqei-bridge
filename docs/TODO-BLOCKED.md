# TODO: Blocked Items

Only items here if stalled on external factors (e.g., user input, tool dependencies). Currently minimal; unblocked most by adding sub-steps or alternatives.

- [ ] Replace synthetic AQEI in `search.wl` with manuscript-derived functionals: Blocked on clarifying "actual AQEI sampling functionals" from literature/user (e.g., Fewster-style worldline averages). Unblock alternative: Use placeholder non-linear constraints via Mathematica's NMaximize with built-in samplers.
- [ ] Integrate Mathlib deeply for sheaf/cohomology invariants (bridge conjecture): Blocked on clarifying which invariant to target first (sheaves? homology of order complexes?); current unblocked substrate is causal posets + Alexandrov-style topology in Lean.
