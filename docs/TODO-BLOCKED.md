# TODO: Blocked Items

Refined to minimize; unblocked most by providing alternatives/sub-steps based on repo state (e.g., use known AQEI proxies from literature). Only truly external blocks remain.

- [ ] Integrate Mathlib for sheaf cohomology (bridge conjecture): Blocked on picking a concrete first invariant + the amount of Mathlib sheaf/cohomology infrastructure we want to depend on.
	Unblock path: start with order-complex homology or simpler order invariants before sheaves.
- [ ] Replace synthetic AQEI constraints with manuscript/literature-derived functionals: Blocked on selecting an explicit first family of sampling curves/weights and corresponding bounds.
- [ ] “Continuity of causal futures under perturbations” (uniform-topology lemmas): Blocked on choosing a concrete topology on the space of futures (and a concrete causal model beyond placeholders).
