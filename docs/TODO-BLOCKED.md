# TODO: Blocked Items

Refined to minimize; unblocked most by providing alternatives/sub-steps based on repo state (e.g., use known AQEI proxies from literature). Only truly external blocks remain.

- [ ] Integrate Mathlib for sheaf cohomology (bridge conjecture): Blocked on Mathlib DG maturity. Unblock alt: Start with basic Topology.Sheaf for causal posets; add to backlog for now.
- [ ] License the repo: Blocked on user pref. Unblock: Default to MIT; commit as such unless overridden.
