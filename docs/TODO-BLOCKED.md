# TODO: Blocked Items

Only items here if stalled on external factors (e.g., user input, tool dependencies). Currently minimal; unblocked most by adding sub-steps or alternatives.

- [ ] Replace synthetic AQEI in `search.wl` with manuscript-derived functionals: Blocked on clarifying "actual AQEI sampling functionals" from literature/user (e.g., Fewster-style worldline averages). Unblock alternative: Use placeholder non-linear constraints via Mathematica's NMaximize with built-in samplers.
- [ ] Integrate Mathlib deeply for sheaf cohomology (bridge conjecture): Blocked on Mathlib's differential geometry maturity (check updates). Unblock: Use basic Topology.Algebra.Sheaf for causal poset invariants as a start.
- [ ] License the repo: Blocked on user preference (MIT vs Apache). Unblock: Use MIT.
