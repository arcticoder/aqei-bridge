# TODO: Backlog (Long-Term)

Refined with completions (poset viz/generator; CTC diagnostics; Phase 4 docs). Promote unblocked work into `docs/TODO.md` in small batches.

## Phase 4: Toward Proof / Disproof & Bridge Conjecture (Long Term)
- [ ] Full conjecture proof: generalize chamber stability beyond discrete toys.
- [ ] Bridge: sheaf cohomology / chronology protection invariant (blocked until concretized; see `docs/TODO-BLOCKED.md`).
- [ ] Cluster support: beyond single-machine multiprocessing (job scheduler integration / resumable distributed sweeps).

## General / Ongoing
- [ ] Visualizations: enhance poset/interval views (e.g. Alexandrov basis overlays in Mathematica) once we choose a concrete representation compatible with deterministic tests.
