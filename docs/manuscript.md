# AQEI-Bridge manuscript (draft)

This is a living draft aligned with the repo’s hybrid workflow:
- Lean: formal, typechecked definitions and statements (eventual proofs)
- Mathematica: heuristic search / counterexample hunting in a toy model
- Python: orchestration + translation into Lean-checkable “certificates”

This draft is intentionally closer in *structure* to the `energy-tensor-cone/papers/` organization
(overview + definitions + main conjecture + formalization plan), but is kept as Markdown until the
mathematical content stabilizes.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Problem statement
We want evidence and eventually a proof (or disproof/refinement) of:

> Metric perturbations generated by AQEI-admissible stress–energy tensors produce a path-connected family
> of causal futures (no change in global causal homotopy class) in small neighborhoods.

See `docs/conjecture.md` for the current mathematical phrasing and caveats.

### 1.2. What this repository contributes
- A repeatable candidate generation loop (toy 1+1D) producing structured artifacts.
- A Lean “interface layer” that keeps speculative/heuristic steps explicitly abstract.

## 2. Definitions and interface layer

### 2.1. Stress–energy and admissibility
- Finite-dimensional toy model: coefficient vectors.
- Tensor-shaped placeholder: symmetric matrices (to be refined).
- AQEI admissibility: currently encoded as a finite list of linear inequalities (polyhedron).

### 2.2. Causality models
- Discrete reachability toy model: directed edge relation, transitive closure, and `J⁺(p)`.
- Order-theoretic causal posets: a preorder `p ≤ q` as an abstract reachability relation.
- Future work: Lorentzian manifold causality and continuity of `J⁺` under small perturbations.

#### 2.2.1. Alexandrov-style topology (order interface)
We add a minimal bridge from causality to topology:

- Start with a causal preorder `≤` on events.
- Define the causal future as the upper set $J^+(p) := \{ q \mid p \le q \}$.
- Put an Alexandrov-style topology on events where *open sets are upper sets*.

This is a deliberately light-weight formal substrate for later “topological obstruction” invariants.

## 3. Hybrid workflow

### 3.1. Stage III (Mathematica)
- Choose an ansatz for the source.
- Solve a linearized toy Green’s-function system.
- Maximize a proxy observable subject to synthetic (placeholder) constraints.

Artifacts:
- `mathematica/results/summary.json`
- `mathematica/results/top_candidates.json`

### 3.2. Stage IV (Python)
- Parse JSON results, rationalize floats, and emit a Lean file containing structured candidate data.
- Persist run records in `runs/<timestamp>/run.json`.

### 3.3. Stage I/II (Lean)
- Keep a clean separation:
  - What’s formalizable now (finite-dimensional convexity, discrete reachability).
  - What remains heuristic (PDE solution operator, link from proxy observable to causal future changes).

## 4. Core conjectures

### 4.1. AQEI-bridge (local stability)
- Parameter-space formulation: path-connectedness of a “good” neighborhood inside the AQEI-admissible region.
- Model-space formulation: stability of `J⁺` under small perturbations (future work).

### 4.2. Global causality as a topological obstruction (bridge goal)
This project’s longer-term direction is to connect causality stability to *topological invariants* of a causal structure.
Candidate ingredients:
- causal posets / causal sets (order-theoretic structure)
- Alexandrov topology and order-interval bases
- invariants stable under small local perturbations

This section is a placeholder for a more precise statement once the Lean model of causality is upgraded.

## 5. Roadmap
- Tighten Lean statements for the discrete model; prove at least one nontrivial stability theorem there.
- Replace synthetic constraints with manuscript-derived sampling functionals.
- Upgrade the causal observable beyond straight-ray integrals.
