- **A.3** `jplus_hausdorff_le_chain` in `lean/src/AqeiBridge/DiscreteFutureContinuity.lean`: for a chain of `k+1` finite causal posets connected step-by-step with Hausdorff ≤ 1, `dH(J⁺(p, c₀), J⁺(p, cₖ)) ≤ k`. Proved by induction using `jplus_hausdorff_le_chain_aux` with `discreteHausdorff_triangle` from `DiscreteHausdorff.lean` and `boundedDist_triangle` from `GraphDistance.lean`.
- **C.1** `lean/src/AqeiBridge/ChamberConstancy.lean` (NEW): `chamber_constancy_global` (abstract), `chamber_constancy_of_convex` (convex corollary), `AQEI_chamber_constancy` (AQEI cone instance), and `AQEI_chamber_constancy_of_bounds_nonneg` (API alias). Uses `Convex.isPreconnected` + `IsLocallyConstant.apply_eq_of_isPreconnected` from Mathlib.
- **Triangle infrastructure**: `boundedDist_triangle` + `boundedDist_self` + `boundedDist_nonneg` in `GraphDistance.lean`; `discreteHausdorff_triangle` + `discreteHausdorff_eq_zero_of_{left,right}_empty` in `DiscreteHausdorff.lean`.
- `lean/src/AqeiBridge.lean`: wired in `AqeiBridge.ChamberConstancy`.
- Ran `lake build AqeiBridge` (3398 jobs, all OK, no errors).


- `lean/src/AqeiBridge/OrderComplexBridge.lean` — **full OC ↔ PosetHom equivalence**:
  - `OC1_to_edge`: injection `OC1 P → Edge (P.toCausalPoset)` using antisymmetry
  - `OC1_to_edge_injective`: proved via `congr_arg` on src/dst projections
  - `bdy1_eq_boundary1_mapDomain`: boundary commutativity (proved by `Finsupp.induction`)
  - `Z1_oc_eq_bot_of_posethom`: PosetHom acyclicity ⇒ OC acyclicity
  - `IsCompatible`: condition `P.rel a b → a.val ≤ b.val` enabling the converse
  - `edgeToOC1`: right inverse of `OC1_to_edge` under `IsCompatible`
  - `mapDomain_OC1_to_edge_right_inv`: `mapDomain ι ∘ mapDomain ι⁻¹ = id` (proved by induction)
  - `Z1_posethom_eq_bot_of_oc`: OC acyclicity ⇒ PosetHom acyclicity (under `IsCompatible`)
  - `Z1_oc_eq_bot_iff`: **full bidirectional equivalence** `Z1_oc R P = ⊥ ↔ Z1 (P.toCausalPoset) R = ⊥`
  - `lean/src/AqeiBridge.lean`: wired in `OrderComplexBridge` (already done in prior commit).
  - `docs/TODO-BLOCKED.md`: marked "Poset homology / order complex" as `[x] DONE`.
  - Ran `./run_tests.sh` (3397 jobs, all OK, no errors).

- `lean/src/AqeiBridge/OrderComplexBridge.lean` (prior entry): OC↪PosetHom bridge theorem (one-direction only):
  - `OC1_to_edge`: injection `OC1 P → Edge (P.toCausalPoset)` using antisymmetry to discharge the strict-edge condition
  - `OC1_to_edge_injective`: injectivity of the injection (proved via `congr_arg` on src/dst projections)
  - `bdy1_eq_boundary1_mapDomain`: boundary-map commutativity `boundary1 (mapDomain ι x) = bdy1 R P x` (proved by `refine Finsupp.induction x ?_ ?_` + `simp` on singleton case using `boundary1_single`, `bdy1_single`, `edgeBoundary`)
  - `Z1_oc_eq_bot_of_posethom`: main bridge theorem — PosetHomologyProxy acyclicity (`Z1 P.toCausalPoset R = ⊥`) implies OC acyclicity (`Z1_oc R P = ⊥`), via `mapDomain_injective`.

  - Ran `./run_tests.sh` (3397 jobs, all OK, no errors).


- `lean/src/AqeiBridge/DiscreteStabilityBridge.lean` (NEW): proved the discrete bridge conjecture:
  - `aqei_bridge_conjecture_discrete`: H₁ = 0 (acyclicity) is stable under AQEI-admissible edge removal, using `h1_stable_small_pert`. The AQEI parameters (`F`, `T`, `hT`) are explicit witnesses.

Completed in two phases (Phase 1: linter/build fixes; Phase 2: docs, deprecation, test cleanup).

### Phase 1 (committed as `fix: eliminate all Lean linter warnings; improve build scripts`)

- **Item 1 — Lean linter warnings:** Fixed all `unnecessarySimpa`, `unusedSectionVars`, and `unusedSimpArgs` warnings in 13 lean/src/AqeiBridge/*.lean files.
- **Item 2 / Item 12 — tests/build_lean.sh:** Updated with full Mathlib-noise filter (matching `energy-tensor-cone`); writes filtered log to `lean/build.log`.
- **Item 14 — run_tests.sh:** Simplified: delegates to `bash tests/build_lean.sh` once; no duplicate `lake build`.

### Phase 2 (committed as `docs: rewrite architecture/code-overview/toy-model; deprecate hybrid workflow artefacts`)

- **Item 3 — docs/architecture.md:** Complete rewrite — replaced 4-stage Mathematica pipeline description with current pure Lean 4 formalization structure (4 layers).
- **Item 4 — docs/code-overview.md:** Full rewrite covering all 30 current Lean source files; removed outdated entries and physics overclaims.
- **Item 5 — docs/conjecture.md:** No action needed; already up to date.
- **Item 6 — docs/toy-model.md:** Replaced with a historical note that redirects to current architecture docs; original content preserved verbatim in an "(Archived)" section.
- **Item 7 — papers/aqei-bridge-hybrid-workflow.md:** Moved to `docs/history/aqei-bridge-hybrid-workflow.md`; removed from `papers/`.
- **Item 8 — papers/aqei-lean-formalization.tex:** No action needed; already up to date.
- **Item 9 — python/analyze_candidates.py:** Archived to `deprecated/python/`; removed from git.
- **Item 10 — python/orchestrator.py:** Archived to `deprecated/python/`; removed from git.
- **Item 11 — results/ directory:** Was already empty and untracked; nothing to do.
- **Item 13 — tests/lean_tests.sh:** Removed inline Python placeholder generation; replaced with a simple 7-line script echoing "Lean tests: OK". `GeneratedPosetConjectures.lean` is now a static checked-in fixture.

## Phase 3 — Lean Proof Tasks (A.1, A.2, B.2, B.3, C.2)

### A.1 — `jplus_hausdorff_le_one_of_edge_diff` (`DiscreteFutureContinuity.lean`)

- Added `jplus_hausdorff_le_one_of_edge_diff`: if P and Q differ on exactly one edge (u,v),
  then `discreteHausdorff (boundedDist symm-P-adj) (JplusFinset P p) (JplusFinset Q p) ≤ 1`.
- Proof uses `FinsetMetric.discreteHausdorff_le_of_forall_exists` directly (avoids the
  heavier `jplus_discreteHausdorff_coverage` wrapper which caused whnf timeout).
- `classical` resolves `DecidableRel` for the symmetrized adjacency inline lambda.
- Key insight: after `obtain ⟨rfl, rfl⟩ := hpq` where `hpq : p = u ∧ q = v`,
  Lean 4 substitutes `u := p` and `v := q` (eliminates the *earlier* params), so
  witness must use `p` and `q` (not `u`/`v`) in the post-substitution context.
- Added three helper lemmas to `GraphDistance.lean`:
  - `boundedDistNat_self`: `boundedDistNat adj v v = 0`
  - `boundedDist_self`: `boundedDist adj v v = 0` (ℝ-valued)
  - `boundedDist_le_one_of_adj`: direct edge → distance ≤ 1

### A.2 — `h1_dim_le_of_subgraph` (`H1Stability.lean`)

- Added `push1_Z1_map`: injective `ℤ`-linear map `Z1(M₁) →ₗ[ℤ] Z1(M₂)` induced by edge inclusion.
- Added `h1_dim_le_of_subgraph`: `Module.rank (Z1 P') ≤ Module.rank (Z1 P)` for subgraph `P' ⊆ P`.
- Key fix: `push1` has `(R : Type)` as **explicit** first positional argument; must use
  `push1 (M₁ := M₁) (M₂ := M₂) ℤ id hsub` not `push1 id hsub` (which passes `id` as `R`).
- Import added: `Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Dimension.Basic`.

### B.2 — `h1_oc_stable_of_subgraph` (`OrderComplexProxy.lean`)

- Added `oc1Embed` (chain complex 1-simplex embedding under subgraph inclusion).
- Added `bdy1_comp_mapDomain_oc1Embed` (boundary compatibility lemma).
- Added `h1_oc_stable_of_subgraph`: `H1_oc P' ≤ H1_oc P` (as submodules of the ambient free module)
  under subgraph inclusion.

### B.3 — `h1_oc_eq_bot_of_acyclic` (`OrderComplexProxy.lean`)

- Added `h1_oc_eq_bot_of_acyclic`: `acyclic P → H1_oc P = ⊥` (vanishing of order-complex H¹
  for acyclic finite posets).

### C.2 — `H1Cech_vanishes_of_exact` (`Cech01.lean`)

- Added `H1Cech_vanishes_of_exact`: if the Čech 0/1/2 cochain complex is exact at degree 1
  (i.e. `ker d1 = im d0`), then `H1Cech = ⊥` (vanishing of the H¹ quotient).
- Proof: `Submodule.Quotient.eq_bot_iff` + exactness ↔ quotient is trivial.
