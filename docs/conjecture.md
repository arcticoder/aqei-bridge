# Conjecture (bridge statement): causal stability under AQEI-admissible perturbations

## Scope and intent

This document states the conjecture in a way that is:

- precise enough to formalize *interfaces* in Lean now, and
- explicit about which parts are **heuristic** vs **formalizable**.

The goal is a bridge paper submission (SciPost Physics) independent of the
CQG-review manuscript, while citing the unpublished manuscript for any
nontrivial analytic/QFT content.

## Background objects (informal mathematics)

Let $(M,g)$ be a Lorentzian spacetime. Let $T_{ab}$ be a (renormalized) stress–energy
expectation value in some QFT state.

### AQEI admissibility (informal)

AQEI constraints are (schematically) lower bounds on averaged null energy
functionals, e.g.

$$
\int_{\gamma} T_{ab} k^a k^b \, w(\lambda)\, d\lambda \ge -B_{\gamma,w}
$$

for families of null/timelike curves $\gamma$ and sampling weights $w$.

**Formalizable now (toy):** represent these as finitely many linear inequalities
$L_i(T) \ge -B_i$ on a finite coefficient vector.

**Not formalized yet:** deriving the correct $L_i, B_i$ from QFT on curved
spacetimes.

### Metric perturbation sourced by $T$

In a weak-field / linearized regime (harmonic gauge as an example), one has a
linear relation between source and perturbation:

$$
\Box h_{ab} = 16\pi S_{ab}(T)
$$

with a Green operator producing $h[T]$.

**Heuristic in current code:** we use a scalar FFT Green multiplier in 1+1 as a toy.

### Causal future family

For a point $p\in M$, the causal future is $J_g^+(p)$. Under perturbed metrics
$g' = g + h[T]$, we get a family

$$
\mathcal{J}_p := \{ J^+_{g+h[T]}(p) : T \in \mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{AQEI}} \cap \mathcal{U} \}
$$

where $\mathcal{U}$ is a small neighborhood (e.g. norm ball) of admissible stress–energy
configurations.

## Conjecture (informal)

> **Causal stability conjecture (bridge form).** In sufficiently small neighborhoods
> of AQEI-admissible stress–energy, the family $\mathcal{J}_p$ is path-connected (and
> does not change the global causal homotopy class).

### What is “formalizable now”

In Lean, we can state a parametric version:

- a type of points `M.Pt`
- an abstract metric `g : Pt → Pt → ℝ` (placeholder)
- an abstract `linearized_solution : StressEnergy n → MetricPerturbation`
- a predicate `CausalFuture g p q`

and then define the *interface statement*.

### What remains heuristic/analytic

- identifying the correct topology on the space of causal futures
- proving continuity of $J^+$ under metric perturbations
- validating the PDE → observable reduction used in computation

## Toward proof (how this comes together)

The long-term conjecture is about continuity/topology of $J^+(p)$ under AQEI-admissible perturbations.
In the near term, the repo is set up to prove *discrete/toy analogues* that mirror the same structure:

- **Discrete model target.** Replace “Lorentzian $J^+$” with reachability in a finite directed graph
	or finite causal preorder, where the reachability relation is induced by a parameter-dependent local rule.
- **Local constancy / chamber picture.** In many finite-dimensional toy reductions, the behavior of the
	optimizer and the induced “future proxy” is constant on regions of parameter space determined by which
	inequalities are active (a hyperplane arrangement / polyhedral chamber decomposition).
	Each chamber is convex, hence path-connected.
- **Connectivity reduces to adjacency.** If the union of relevant chambers is connected via shared facets,
	then the family of (proxy) futures varies in a path-connected way. This is the toy analogue of
	“no change in causal homotopy class inside a small neighborhood”.

This motivates the current computational diagnostics:

- The multi-ray “connectedness proxy” (Jaccard overlap of per-ray active constraint sets) is a crude way
	to detect whether different rays appear to live in the same or adjacent chambers.

What still requires analytic input (not yet in this repo):

- a precise topology/metric on the hyperspace of futures (sets $J^+(p)$),
- and a proof that the physically meaningful $J^+$ map is continuous under the perturbations generated by
	AQEI-admissible $T$.

Lean status (toy):

- The “convex chamber ⇒ path-connected” step is formalized for a closed-chamber model in
	`lean/src/AqeiBridge/Chambers.lean`.
- As a corollary, the toy `AQEI_cone` is path-connected under a mild feasibility assumption
	(`0 ≤ B` for each bound so that `T=0` is admissible).

- Discrete-toy implication: if a parameter-to-`DiscreteSpacetime` map is constant on each chamber,
  then the induced discrete futures are constant on chambers (`lean/src/AqeiBridge/DiscreteChamberStability.lean`).

- Chamber-indexed discrete model: we can *construct* such a locally constant map by factoring through a
	chamber index induced by the AQEI functionals (`lean/src/AqeiBridge/ChamberIndexedModel.lean`).

- Active-set vs sign-pattern chambers: `ClosedChamber F active` always implies `active ⊆ chamberIndex F T`,
  and on interior points (inactive constraints strict) we get `chamberIndex F T = active`
  (`lean/src/AqeiBridge/ChamberClosedChamberBridge.lean`).

## Step 2: tie-ins to “topology / reachability / flow” themes (toy)

The repo does **not** prove any warp-drive feasibility statement. What it *can* do today is support
evidence-building for a structured narrative:

- **Theme A (global causality as topological obstruction).**
	- Proxy object: a directed graph / causal poset representing a toy causal structure.
	- Proxy invariant: `z1Dim = dim ker(∂₁)` computed by `python/poset_homology_proxy.py` (graph formula `|E|-|V|+c`).
	- Interpretation: if a perturbation leaves `z1Dim` unchanged across a neighborhood of parameters, that’s evidence
		that *this* low-degree proxy invariant is stable under that perturbation family.
	- Caveat: `Z₁` is **not** equivalent to “CTCs exist” (a DAG can have nontrivial `Z₁`). Treat it as a coarse
		“cycle-space” detector, not as chronology protection.

- **Theme B (reachability theorems).**
	- In this repo’s discrete toys, “reachability” is just graph reachability (a stand-in for $J^+(p)$).
	- The cone-widening perturbation (`sweep-minkowski-perturb`) is a toy for “making more events timelike-reachable”
		by locally widening the allowed step set. If reachability expands but `z1Dim` stays stable, that’s a toy analogue
		of “more reachability without changing a low-degree causal invariant.”
	- Caveat: this is not a Lorentzian theorem; it’s a discrete diagnostic.

- **Theme C (Einstein equations as a flow on metric space).**
	- The scan harness (`scan-minkowski-perturb`) is a practical stand-in for exploring a parameter family of
		“metric deformations” and asking where low-degree invariants are stable.
	- It’s not a geometric flow solver. It’s a *map* from a parameter tuple `(epsilon, cutoff, window)` to a distribution
		of toy causal graphs. This is still useful, because it lets you empirically identify stable “basins” where the toy
		invariant doesn’t jump.

Pointers:
- How to run these scans is documented in `docs/phase4_searches.md`.

## Step 3: optimize for personal evidence (not publication)

If your goal is “enough evidence to decide next engineering steps” rather than a publication-grade proof, optimize for:

1. **Reproducibility first.** Always run with explicit seeds and save JSON/CSV artifacts.
2. **Stability regions, not single runs.** Prefer `scan-minkowski-perturb` over one-off runs.
3. **Two metrics, not one.** Track both:
	 - `fractionUnchanged` for `z1Dim`, and
	 - a separate cycle/CTC proxy (`python/ctc_scan.py` or `python/causal_graph_tools.py ctc`) when relevant.
4. **Define a stop condition.** For example: “move on if `fractionUnchanged ≥ 0.9` across a 3×3×2 parameter grid
	 for two grid sizes and two seeds.”
5. **Escalate the toy only when it breaks.** If stability is too fragile, adjust the perturbation model
	 (e.g. smaller `epsilon`, larger smoothing `window`, or a different local rule). If stability is overly robust,
	 increase model fidelity (beyond step-cone widening).

Suggested minimal runbook:
- Start with `tmax=xmax=6`, `trials=20`, 2–3 seeds.
- Grid: `epsilons 0.0,0.1,0.2`, `cutoffs -0.1,0.0,0.1`, `windows 5,9`.
- Export CSV (`--csv-out`) and plot `fractionUnchanged` vs parameters.

This is deliberately framed as a disciplined *diagnostics loop*: it helps decide what to formalize next in Lean
(e.g. which perturbation families plausibly preserve invariants), without overclaiming physics.

## Lean interface sketch (current repo)

The current Lean repo already contains typed placeholders in:

- `lean/src/AqeiBridge/CausalStability.lean`

As the bridge paper matures, replace `axiom causal_stability : True` with a
concrete statement for a discrete spacetime model, then generalize.
